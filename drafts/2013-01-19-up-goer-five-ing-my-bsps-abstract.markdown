Inspired by a recent 
[xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/1133/),
people have started to try to explain complex stuff using only the
1000 most common words.
There's a special [text editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) 
that keeps you on track.
Taking time out from the dreaded thesis corrections,
I've decided to try to rewrite my abstract for this years BSPS 
in this restricted form.

<!-- more -->

So, here is my attempt at using only the most common words to explain
my abstract about rationality and theory choice.

{% blockquote %}
People often understand good thinking to mean that all things you do are fixed by  good thinking. I think good thinking can be less strong. Sometimes you can do one thing or another and good thinking doesn't help you pick.

This also happens in when we have to pick how to think about what things there are and how they move around. Sometimes there can be more than one picture about how the things move and good thinking doesn't need to make one the best: they can both be quite good. But sometimes one picture is stupid and good thinking does say "no not that picture".

So thinking about how things move around and do stuff doesn't act like the normal idea of good thinking, but it does act like my less strong idea of good thinking.
{% endblockquote %}

As you can see, 
not being able to use the words "rationality", "science" and "theory"
required some rather awkward circumlocutions.
