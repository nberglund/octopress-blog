This is the first of a series of posts I am going to write as a way to get together my thoughts for a new paper.
An early version of this stuff appeared in my thesis, so I already have a pretty good idea what I'm going to be writing
about.
The paper is ultimately going to be about indeterminate credence.
I think there are plenty of disparate reasons for perhaps wanting to take
imprecise or indeterminate credence seriously, so I'm going to write a paper outlining them all.

First, a note on terminology.
I'm pretty used to calling these things "imprecise credences",
but [I've been convinced](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/47077/) 
that it's probably better to call them "indeterminate credences",
since "imprecise credence" could have another meaning.
Basically, the "imprecise probabilities" terminology is all 
[Peter Walley's](http://books.google.de/books/about/Statistical_reasoning_with_imprecise_pro.html?id=Nk9Qons1kHsC&redir_esc=y) 
fault.
Well, at least it's better than "mushy credence".
Ugh.
I'm going to try to stick to talking about indeterminate credence,
but I expect I won't manage.
Also, I'm going to try having a page where I list all the posts in this series.

OK.
This is a sort of warm-up post where I'm just going to put out some sort of formal details I'll need later.
I'm going to assume everyone knows what a probability function is.
I'm going to use $p\_1,p\_2,\dots$ for probability functions.
Indeterminate credence is represented by a set of probability functions $C$.
Call $C(X)$ the set of values that $p\in C$ assign to $X$.
$C^*(X)$ and $C\_*(X)$ are going to be the upper and lower ends of $C(X)$ respectively.
