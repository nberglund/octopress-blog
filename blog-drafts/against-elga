Uh oh.
I've been thinking about Elga's 
[*Subjective Probabilities Should Be Sharp*](http://www.princeton.edu/~adame/papers/sharp/elga-subjective-probabilities-should-be-sharp.pdf)
again.
So [like I said](/blog/2013/03/05/static-and-dynamic-norms-versus-preferring-and-not-dispreferring/),
I think there's something odd with Elga's argument. 
But today I want to puzzle more about the general argumentative strategy.

Elga's argument can be summarised as follows:

 - Imprecise decision rules have intuitively bad decision theoretic consequences
 - Therefore, subjective probabilities should precise

The [paper](http://www.seamusbradley.net/Papers/elga.pdf)
that Katie Steele and I have been working on is basically targeting the first
point.
In this post I am more concerned with the move from the first to the second,
so I'm just going to grant Elga the first point for now.

It seems to me that if Elga's argument were successful,
 an analogous argument could be made that subjective probabilities should be
*trivial*.
Call a probability trivial if it assigns only 0 and 1 to events.

Here's the idea.
You are offered a sequence of bets on whether a fair coin will land heads or tails.
The bets are at even odds.
You have belief one half that the coin will land heads.
Your utility is linear in money.
(This assumption does two distinct things: rules out risk aversion, and guarantees constant marginal utility of money.
That's a topic for another post)
You are therefore indifferent between betting on heads or on tails for each toss
(assuming, that is, the normal expected utility framework for how beliefs inform decisions).
On average, you'll break even.

This is a bad outcome if you compare it to an agent who has the right sort of trivial belief.
Consider the agent who has belief 1 in heads for all the tosses that land heads,
and belief 1 in tails for all the tosses that land tails.
