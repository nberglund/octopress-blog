So here's an idea I had a while ago.
I wrote about this on 
[my old blog](http://incompetnce.wordpress.com/2011/11/18/lewis-semantics-of-counterfactuals-entails-determinism/), 
but I want to redo it from scratch.
I am still just as ignorant of the subtleties of Lewis'
view, so I'm sure there's a problem with what I'm writing below.
However, I don't know where it is.

The basic conclusion is that if we understand Lewis as a
systematic philosopher, then his view of counterfactuals
and his view of laws of nature are such that
the truth value of a counterfactual is determined
by the truth value of its consequent.

Take your favourite counterfactual.
For this post I'll be using 
"If Oswald hadn't shot Kennedy, he would still be alive".
This is interestingly ambiguous between whether the "he" refers
to Kennedy or Oswald.
In either case, I'm guessing you could make the case that
the counterfactual is true but for definiteness, let's say it's Kennedy.
So this is a counterfactual that looks like this: $A\to B$.
We have $A$ standing for "Oswald doesn't shoot Kennedy" and
$B$ stands for "Kennedy is alive".
Let's ignore issues of time, tense or temporality.
They're besides the point here.
We're using "$\to$" to mean the counterfactual conditional here,
since mathjax doesn't seem to understand `\boxright` but never mind.

OK.
So how does Lewis' semantics for counterfactuals work?
Here's a caricature.
"$A\to B$ is true if, in the closest possible world where $A$ is true,
$B$ is also true."
Nice.

So, take the closest possible world where Oswald doesn't shoot Kennedy.
This is presumably a world where Kennedy doesn't get shot
and thus a world where Kennedy lives.
So, given that the closest $A$ world is a $B$ world,
the counterfactual is true.

I think Lewis' analysis here is conceptually useful,
and as a tool for thinking about how to reason about counterfactuals,
it's spot on.
That is, if you take "closeness of possible worlds" to be
contextually defined, then, given a context, you've got a simple way
of understanding what counterfactuals are true.

But I have a worry about _Lewis'_ use of his semantics.
That is, Lewis was a modal realist:
there really are possible worlds, 
and there really is a fact of the matter about what possible worlds are closer than
others.
This I find deeply troubling.

So what would this objective closeness relation look like?
Trading on other areas of Lewis' work,
let's take the "Humean mosaic" of non-modal facts as the basic thing
that characterises a possible world, and define closeness of possible worlds 
a similarity relation between Humean mosaics.
This has some troubling consequences.

Again, let's consider the nearest possible world where Oswald
didn't shoot Kennedy.
Earlier we said that this was presumably a possible world
where Kennedy doesn't get shot.
But here is another $A$ world:
Oswald doesn't shoot Kennedy, but a bullet materialises
at the end of Oswald's gun barrel and flies towards Kennedy, killing him.
This is by stipulation a world where Oswald doesn't shoot.
But it is a world where Kennedy dies.
Which of these $A$ worlds is closer to the actual world?

Intuitively, the answer is obviously that worlds where bullets materialise
out of thin air are worlds rather far removed from the actual world.
Thus, our original $A$ world is closer.
But if we're measuring differences in non-modal properties at spatiotemporal points,
then the world where the bullet materialises is identical at more points in the Humean
mosaic, and thus counts as closer.
So the counterfactual is false.

This is tricky, so I want to say that again.
We have two putative $A$ worlds, and which one is closer to the actual
is the relevant one for deciding the truth of the counterfactual.
In one $A$ world, Oswald doesn't shoot.
In the other, Oswald doesn't shoot, but a bullet appears _as if_ he had.
Which is closer to the actual?
Well, by stipulation, the only difference is the appearance of a bullet.
And since _the bullet is there in the actual world_ the second
possibility can't fail to be closer!
There's only one difference between the worlds, 
and the second world is closer in that respect,
so it is closer overall.

And for any claimed true counterfactual, I can make the same sort of argument.
For any putative $A\to B$ counterfactual where $A$ and $B$ are false in the
actual world, I can undermine an analysis of its truth.
That is, you claim that the nearest $A$ world is a $B$ world,
and I can always find a closer $A$ world where $B$ is false.
Here's how:
I take your $A$ world, and I say "Now imagine a world like that (such that $A$ is true)
but everything else is as if $B$ were false."
Now given that the only relevant difference is the truth-value of $B$, 
and $B$ is false in the actual world, my possible world _has to be closer to the actual_.

The obvious response to this is that I'm cheating!
I'm using the wrong notion of closeness of possible worlds.
In the actual world, bullets don't just appear out of thin air.
So worlds where that sort of thing happens are just really remote.
But this isn't an avenue of defense open to a real Lewisian.
This defense requires a pre-existing idea about laws of nature.
It requires that the laws of nature forbid magically appearing bullets,
and worlds with different laws are really remote from the actual.

But Lewis can't take this route out.
For Lewis, the laws supervene on the non-modal facts,
so closeness in terms of the non-modal facts _must_ be the better closeness relation.

Note a similar argument for counterfactuals with true consequents have them always coming
out true.
So the upshot of this is that _things could not have been otherwise_.
If you take Lewis' view of counterfactuals seriously
and make it consistent with Lewis' other views (specifically those on laws of nature)
then the truth value of counterfactuals are determined by the truth value of their
consequents.

Alan HÃ¡jek has a paper called "Most counterfactuals are false" which 
has a conclusion in a similar vein,
but I think this is an interestingly different argument.

As I said at the start there _must_ be something wrong with this argument.
But I don't know nearly enough about Lewis to spot it.
And I don't currently have the time to read up enough to see where the 
flaw is.
