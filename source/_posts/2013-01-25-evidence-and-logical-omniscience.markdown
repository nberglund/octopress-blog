There seems to be a tension between some putative norms of epistemology.
On the one hand, you are required to believe things you have
evidence for.
On the other hand, you are normatively compelled to
believe all the logical truths.
But you have no evidence for most logical truths.
What to make of this puzzle?

Any sensible epistemology should have some norm
that says something like 
"You are justified in believing those sentences
you have evidence for".
Or something like that.
Well, that's actually probably the wrong way to put it.
You can have evidence for something that is undermined by
other stronger evidence.
So let's put the norm like this:
"You are not justified in believing sentences
you have no evidence for".
Now, for some suitably broad definition of evidence,
I think this is a reasonable norm on belief.
I can't help quoting 
[W.K. Clifford](http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/w_k_clifford/ethics_of_belief.html)
on this point:

{% blockquote %}
it is wrong always, everywhere and for anyone to believe anything on insufficient evidence 
{% endblockquote %}

And 
[William James](http://educ.jmu.edu/~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html)
agrees up to a point:

{% blockquote %}
All this strikes one as healthy, even when expressed by Clifford with somewhat too much robustious pathos in the voice. Free-will and simple wishing do seem, in the matter of our credences, to be only fifth wheels to the coach.
{% endblockquote %}

James actually ends up saying that it is permissible
to believe things consistent with your
evidence, which allows you to believe things
you don't have evidence for.
But I've always found Clifford to
be more right on this than James.
Anyway, we'll come back to this discussion in a second.

Here's another putative rational requirement:
"You ought to believe all the logical truths".
That is, it normally follows from the norms on rational belief
that you ought to be logically omniscient.
I've talked about this before.
([Once](/blog/2012/02/22/decision-theory-for-the-logically-ignorant/),
[Twice](/blog/2012/02/28/dutch-booking-the-logically-ignorant/),
and [Thrice](/blog/2012/03/05/who-cares-about-logical-ignorance/)).
For the moment I'm going to stick to categorical yes/no belief,
but I think everything I say is also true of the graded case.
Obviously, this is way too strong an assumption
to be reasonable of actual agents:
it is a counsel of perfection.
But it is a counsel nonetheless:
what reason could you have for failing to believe
a logical truth except ignorance?

What counts as evidence for a logical truth?
Obviously, a proof of a logical truth should count as evidence for it.
Perhaps we have some sort of inductive evidence that counts in favour of
certain open conjectures like Goldbach's conjecture or
the twin prime conjecture.
But the problem is, that even if we allow all this,
*you have no evidence for most logical truths*.
Most logical truths are longer than all the strings of formal symbols
we have ever written down.
And thus longer than any possible proof of them that we have considered.
This is for exactly the same reason that most finite numbers are bigger than
all the numbers we have ever dealt with.
It seems crazy that I should be rationally required to believe an
enormous class of sentences for which I have no evidence.
It seems odd that an agent could be rationally required to believe
a huge class of sentences that she *couldn't possibly* be justified in believing.

I take this as a reason to doubt that logical omniscience can really be a 
norm of rational belief.
We need something weaker.
We need to capture the idea that only ignorance could be a reason
for failing to believe a logical truth.
But we also need to allow agents to be ignorant in that way.

In fact, I'm not sure we really need an extra norm.
What we need is a notion of evidence that allows that 
evidence for $T$ is also evidence for $T \vee X$,
but is not evidence for some extremely long complex formula
that happens to be logically equivalent to $T$.
Then the evidential norm above is enough to guarantee that you
are required to believe the logical truths it is reasonable
to expect you to be able to believe.
The real change is in doing epistemology in a framework that 
even *allows* such failure of logical omniscience.
See above posts for why this is non-trivial.

I think the basic problem here is that 
*evidence and justification are intensional*.
You see Clark Kent walk into the office.
You are justified in believe Clark Kent is in the office,
but not that Superman is in the office.
Same thing is going on in the evidence for logical truths case:
evidence for one sentence needn't be evidence for
a sentence extensionally equivalent with it.
People must have talked about this stuff,
but I just don't know the mainstream epistemology literature
well enough to know where to look.
