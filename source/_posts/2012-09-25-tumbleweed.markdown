It's been pretty quiet around here lately.
I handed in my PhD thesis recently.
In the feverish weeks leading up to that event, 
I didn't have a lot of time for blogging.
In the relatively relaxed week since,
I've felt no compulsion to write anything.
I am now back from a 
[conference in Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/structuralism/closing-conference/)
and am slowly getting back into working.
I have more half-finished projects than I'd care to count,
so I expect some of them to end up 
making an appearance as blog posts in the near future.
