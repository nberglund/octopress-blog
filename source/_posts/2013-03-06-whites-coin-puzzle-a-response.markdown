So I carved off a short section of my thesis and tidied it up into a little paper
on Roger White's coin puzzle for imprecise credences.
If you like that sort of thing,
you can find the paper
[over here](http://www.seamusbradley.net/Papers/coins-redux.pdf) (PDF).
Comments welcome!
By email, or by twitter if you're hip and modern.
And your comment is less than 140 characters.

I'm not going to summarise the paper here because it's only 6 pages long,
and you might as well just read it!
