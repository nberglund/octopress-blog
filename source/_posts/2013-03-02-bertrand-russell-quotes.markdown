Flicking through the "my clippings" thing on my kindle for my 
[Chandler quotes](/blog/2013/02/27/raymond-chandler-quotes/)
post, I realised that I have many gems from Russell's
*History of Western Philosophy* also saved on there.
Again, this reflects more on what I find amusing than on what
Russell wrote or thought.
While we're on the subject of Russell, Jorge Luis Borges, in an article about Zeno's paradox
describes Russell as "inhumanly lucid".

{% blockquote %}
Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but must be endured if we wish to  live without the support of comforting fairy tales.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
It is clear that each party to this dispute -- as to all that persist through long periods of time -- is partly right and partly wrong.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
The civilised man is distinguished from the savage mainly by prudence, or, to use a slightly wider term, forethought. He is willing to endure present pains for the sake of future pleasures, even if the future pleasures are rather distant.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
He founded a religion, of which the main tenets were the transmigration of the soul and the sinfulness of eating beans. His religion was embodied in a religious order, which, here and there, acquired control of the State and established a rule of the saints. But the unregenerate hankered after beans, and sooner or later rebelled.
{% endblockquote %}

(I think he is talking about Pythagoras here, and in the next quote.)

{% blockquote %}
To those who have reluctantly learnt a little mathematics in school this may seem strange; but to those who have experienced the intoxicating delight of sudden understanding that mathematics gives, from time to time, to those who love it, the Pythagorean view will seem completely natural even if untrue. It might seem that the empirical philosopher is the slave of his material, but that the pure mathematician, like the musician, is free creator of his world of ordered beauty.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
To learn to conceive the universe according to each of these systems is an imaginative delight and an antidote to dogmatism. Moreover, even if no one of the hypotheses can be demonstrated, there is genuine knowledge in the discovery of what is involved in making each of them consistent with itself and with known facts.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
His words, like those of all the philosophers before Plato, are known only through quotations, largely made by Plato and Aristotle for the sake of refutation. When one thinks what would become of any modern philosopher if he were only known through the polemics of his rivals, one can see how admirable the pre-Socratics must have been, since even through the mist of malice spread by their enemies they still appear great.
{% endblockquote %}

This next one is Russell quoting Protagoras:
{% blockquote %}
"With regard to the gods, I cannot feel sure either that they are or that they are not, nor what they are like in figure; for there are many things that hinder sure knowledge, the obscurity of the subject and the shortness of human life"
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Any logically coherent body of doctrine is sure to be in part painful and contrary to prejudices.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
What is important to the historian of the world is not the petty wars between Greek cities, or the sordid squabbles for the part ascendancy, but the memories retained by mankind when the brief episode was ended -- like the recollection of a brilliant sunrise in the Alps, while the mountaineer struggles through and arduous day of wind and snow.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
But whatever Socrates may say, it remains the case, as any one can see, that people who stick to philosophy become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues; even the best of them are made useless by philosophy.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
This is, I think, what Aristotle means. His doctrine on this point, as on many others, is a common-sense prejudice pedantically expressed.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Scepticism was a lazy man's consolation, since it showed the ignorant to be as wise as the reputed men of learning. To the men who, by temperament, required a gospel, it might seem unsatisfying, but like every doctrine of the Hellenistic perios it reccommended itself as an antidote to worry. Why trouble about the future? It is wholly uncertain. You may as well enjoy the present; "what's to come is still unsure". For these reasons, Scepticism enjoyed a considerable success.
{% endblockquote %}

This is Russell quoting a sceptic:
{% blockquote %}
"We sceptics follow in practice the way of the world, but without holding any opinion about it. We speak of the Gods as existing and offer worship to the Gods and say that they exercise providence, but in saying this we express no belief, and avoid the rashness of dogmatizers."
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Against brother-sister incest there is a very curious argument: that if the love of husband and wife were combined with that of brother and sister, mutual attractions would be so strong as to cause unduly frequent intercourse.
{% endblockquote %}

Here's Russell on Rousseau:
{% blockquote %}
Science and virtue, he held, are incompatible, and all sciences have an ignoble origin. Astronomy comes from the superstition of astrology; eloquence from ambition; geometry from avarice; physics from vain curiosity; and even ethics has its source in human pride.
{% endblockquote %}

Here's Russell quoting Rousseau in a letter to Voltaire, whom he had fallen out with.
{% blockquote %}
If there is nothing in you that I can honour but your talents, that is no fault of mine.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
"Ah Madame!" writes Rousseau to an aristocratic lady, "sometimes in the privacy of my study, with my hands pressed tight over my eyes or in the darkness of the night , I am of opinion that there is no God. But look yonder: the rising sun, as it scatters the mists that cover the earth, and lays bare the wondrous glimmering scene of nature, disperses at the same moment all cloud from my soul. I find my faith again and my God and my belief in Him. I admire and adore Him, and I prostrate myself in His presence."
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
This illustrates an important truth, namely, that the worse your logic, the more interesting the consequences to which it gives rise.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
Philosophers may differ as to the definition of "truth", but at any rate it is something objective, something which, in some sense, everybody ought to accept. No man would engage in the pursuit of philosophy if he thought that all philosophy is merely an expression of irrational bias.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
We may say, in a broad way, that Greek philosophy down to Aristotle expresses the mentality appropriate to the City State; that Stoicism is appropriate to a cosmopolitan despotism; the scholastic philosophy is an intellectual expression of the Church as an organization; that philosophy since Descartes, or at any rate since Locke, tends to embody the prejudices of the commercial middle class; and that Marxism and Fascism are philosophies appropriate to the modern industrial State.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
For one reason or another, we all find it impossible to maintain an attitude of sceptical detachment on many issues as to which pure reason is silent. A "philosophy", in a very usual sense of the word, is an organic whole of such extra-rational decisions.
{% endblockquote %}
