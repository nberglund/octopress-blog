I think I may have posted about this once on my old blog.
But it's a brave new world here,
so let's write about it again.
Often, in conversation,
I hear a phrase that I think would be an amusing name
for a band.
So I make a note of the name,
and guess what sort of genre this imaginary band might
belong to.
It's a fun game.

Here are the results:

 - Hippie Narwhal – Prog rock
 - Quantum Heat Death Magic – Geek rock
 - Limp-wristed Enchiladas – Mexican folk
 - Cocktail Autism – Indie disco
 - Systematic Internaliser – Techno
 - Beer Muffin – Art rock
 - Filfth Correspondent – Indie rock
 - Bestiality Clarke – Folk
 - Wheezy Alpaca – Rockabilly
 
I guess what we can conclude from this is that
I end up in some _weird_ conversations.
And no, I can't remember the context for most of these.
 
On the same subject, here is a list of 
[10,000 statistically grammar averaged fake band names](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~bwhitman/10000.html).
I'm not quite sure I should find this list so funny.
