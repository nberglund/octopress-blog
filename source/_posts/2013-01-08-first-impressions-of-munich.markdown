As I mentioned in my last post, I have a post doc position in Munich.
I have now moved to Munich and am gainfully employed as a philosopher.
Here I have collected a couple of first impressions of Munich.

<!-- more -->

One thing I like about Munich is that the architecture is often very impressive.
It's hard to wander around the city without bumping into huge, impressive,
palatial buildings.
Much of this building is due to the extravagance of the Bavarian
Princes and Kings (who were typically named Ludwig or Maximilian).
The scale and sheer number of these huge constructions is staggering.
London has its tall buildings and its pretty buildings,
but you have to really seek them out:
you don't tend to just turn a corner and go 
"Wow, that's a rather large building." with the same frequency that you do in Munich.

While we're on the subject, the history of Bavaria is a little confusing.
Basically, the Wittelsbachs were in charge for a good seven hundred years,
and they had the annoying habit of mostly being called Ludwig or Maximilian.
At first they were dukes, then prince electors of the Holy Roman Empire,
then they became a kingdom in 1806.
Now, when they became a kingdom, Maximilian IV Elector of Bavaria
became Maximilian I King of Bavaria.
He was succeded by Ludwig I, Maximilian II and Ludwig II.
This naming scheme does not help work out who build what.
I suppose France had a lot of King Louis, but at least they didn't 
just arbitrarily reboot the numbering system at one stage.

Another thing that I was surprised to learn is that Bavaria is predominantly Catholic.
I guess because of the fact that Martin Luther was German,
I just sort of assumed that all of Germany became Protestant.
But no, the Duchy of Bavaria fought for the Catholics in the Thirty Years War.
I guess it makes sense since, being the South-Eastern part of Germany,
Bavaria is quite close to (Catholic) Italy.
Incidentally, Austria is also predominantly Catholic.
This also surprised me. 
I guess I just had this idea that German speakers would be predisposed to
Protestantism, but that's clearly crazy.
Munich's cathedral is called Frauenkirche,
the Frau in question being the Virgin Mary.
Munich's main square, Marienplatz, is named after the 
Mariensäule, a marble column topped with a golden statue of Mary holding a 
little baby jeebus.
The marble column's base has the names of various Popes engraved on it.
Can't get much more Catholic than that.

People here tend to say "Grüß Gott" rather than "Hallo".
I've also heard people say "Merci" rather than "Danke".

Without wanting to further propagate any stereotypes about the Germans,
I was struck by how rule-abiding most people are.
Cyclists stop at traffic lights, and they slow down to give pedestrians right of way.
Jay-walking is much less common than it is in London.
On the S-bahn, the doors will open on both sides but the announcer will
have told you which side you should alight from the train:
everybody actually follows the instruction!
When there is a sign that says "no entry", no one tries to enter!
As someone used to Londoners' fairly relaxed attitudes to rules of this kind,
the difference is striking.

The rental market is a bit of a nightmare.
I am trying to find a flat and it is not fun.
Estate agents charge anything up to 2.38 months' rent as their fee.
On top of a deposit amounting to about 2 months' rent, 
this is a huge upfront cost for renting.
I went to view a room in a shared house,
the viewing felt more like an interview.
It's a seller's market, so the current occupant could basically choose
who he wants to live with him.
I hate the uncertainty of not knowing where I'm going to be living,
so this has been a rather stressful few days.

Still, my new colleagues are nice,
and I have only really scratched the surface of the variety of excellent beer
on offer in Munich.
I am also looking forward to collecting my walking boots from London and then
I can take a train into the alps and go walking!
