So I am writing a paper about nonprobabilistic chance.
What does that even mean!?
Well, [read the paper](http://www.seamusbradley.net/Papers/nonprobchance.pdf) (PDF).
I'd love feedback.

Basically, the idea is that we have a pretheoretic idea
of "chance".
Whenever we discuss chance or use chance, 
it is assumed that probability theory is 
the appropriate formal representation of chance.
I argue that this isn't as straightforward
as it seems.
I don't think this is groundbreaking stuff,
but it's more a case of pointing out
a gap in current arguments,
and showing how one might fill it.
That said, I do think it's perfectly consistent to 
think there are nonprobabilistic chances.
That is, I don't think any of the ways to plug the gap are
generally compelling.

This is work that grew out of thinking about
nonprobabilistic credences.
I think arguments for "chance-probabilism"
are stronger than the arguments for credences,
but not strong enough.

Why am I spending time writing this paper when I should 
be writing my thesis, I hear you ask.
Well, this is a nice break from the ol' thesis.
Also, this paper is what I'm sending to some conferences
this summer.
(I am also sending a different decision theory paper to
some conferences, but that's joint work, so 
I don't want to put up a draft without permission.
Also, that paper is taking a while to write itself.)
So once I've submitted this to the PSA, 
I should probably get back to the thesis.
