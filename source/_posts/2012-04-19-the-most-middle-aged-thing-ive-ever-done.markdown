Last night we watched an episode of Lewis.
One of the subplots involved an amateur orchestra.
They were rehearsing Gustav Holst's _The Planets_.
This afternoon, I decided to buy _The Planets_ on CD.

Being inspired by gentle police drama to buy classical music.
This has to be the most middle-aged thing I've ever done.
I still have a young person's railcard!
This shouldn't be happening to me!

Incidentally, I'm listening to _Mars_ at the moment,
and I get the strong suspicion that John Williams was
inspired by this when scoring _Star Wars_â€¦
