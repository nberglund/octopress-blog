I am currently at
the British Society for the Philosophy of Science
annual conference.
This is serving as part of my time off from
thesis-writing.
What fun.
I am going to be writing up my experiences 
of the conference.

There are many parallel sessions
so I can't comment on all the talks.
And indeed, I won't even comment on
all of the talks I've attended.

The conference kicked off this morning
with a plenary session from Hasok Chang
talking about *Active Scientific Realism*.
Hasok's project is to move scientific realism
beyond "foot-stamping".
"Active Scientific Realism" in slogan form is
a commitment to try to get at reality.
This is contrasted with the standard view, with its
insistence on *truth*.
