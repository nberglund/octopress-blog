"If I were to let go of this ball, it would fall to the floor" is true and
"If I were to let go of this ball, it would turn into an aardvark" is false.
How do we come to learn about these sorts of constructions?
Everybody and their Mum knows that David Lewis offered an account of the semantics
of these counterfactual conditionals.
But he didn't offer much in the way of and understanding of 
*why* we make the intuitive judgements that we do.
Indeed, it was the intuitive judgements of the truth or falsity that Lewis
took as the *data* that his theory needed to accommodate.
I'd like to try to give some sort of analysis of how we come to 
learn the truth or falsity of certain counterfactuals
using something like Lewis' analysis of the truth conditions of counterfactuals.

Uh-oh!
I've been thinking about counterfactuals again.
This is a very rough sketch of an idea I had
a few days ago.
Comments appreciated.
(My comments policy is outlined on the 
[About](/about/) page of this blog.)

# Lewis' Semantics

Put very crudely, Lewis' possible world semantics says that a 
counterfactual of the form $A\Rightarrow C$ is true just in case
all the closest $A$-worlds are also $C$-worlds.
An $A$-world is a possible world where $A$ is true and likewise
for $C$.
What makes it true that "If I were to drop this ball, it would fall to the floor"
is the fact that all the closest possible worlds where
I drop the ball are also worlds where it falls to the floor.
I am actually a creature that inhabits this possible world, 
rather than some other.
So what Lewis' semantics actually needs is that the closest worlds
where *my counterpart* drops a counterpart of this ball,
that counterpart drops to (a counterpart of) the floor.
Lots has been written on Lewis' account of counterfactuals,
questioning many of the concepts I have just appealed to;
counterparts, closeness of worlds, possible worlds themselves.
I am just going to take all this stuff for granted for now.

# Epistemology of Counterfactuals

What I am worrying about is this: How did I come to know that this 
particular counterfactual is true?
I have certainly never had any direct epistemic access to other possible worlds.
I don't feel that I can simply intuit the truth of certain facts
about nearby possible worlds.
There must be things about this world that I have witnessed or been told
about that ground my knowledge of the counterfactual.
But now let's refocus this question:
how do I come to learn that letting go of a ball means that it
will drop to the floor?
I am going to take it as read that the answer to this question 
is some suitably philosophical elaboration of the following intuitive answer:
"Well, I've seen people let go of things before,
and I know what happens to them: 
they fall to the floor (and they don't turn into aardvarks)".
In the simplest case, I've dropped this ball many times before 
and have observed that it falls to the floor.
But I don't need to have observed this ball falling to the floor
when dropped to know that it will fall when let go of:
my knowledge that that counterfactual holds true
could well come from my having seen different balls dropped
by other people.
In brief: I have observed counterparts of this ball
subjected to the antecedent of the counterfactual conditional
and observed that the consequent holds true in those circumstances.
This is at once a crude approximation to the basic idea of 
the experimental method, and more generally, the source of much of our 
knowledge of the world.

So the basic idea is this: I have observed counterparts of the situation
described by the antecedent of the counterfactual, 
and have observed that the consequent also holds true in
those situations.
These counterparts inhabit the actual world 
(since that is the world I am equipped to learn about).
What about this counterfactual: 
"If I were to let go of this handrail on the underground,
it would fall to the ground".
This, presumably, is a false counterfactual.
Now, if previously observed dropped balls counted as counterparts
to the handrail, this analysis would be in trouble.
So presumably there is some sort of "closeness relation" or "salience relation"
that tells you what actual things count as counterparts of the
objects that appear in counterfactuals you learn about.
And hopefully this restriction allows us to rule out the dropped ball
being among those things we have observed that are evidence for
the handrail counterfactual's truth.
We are giving an epistemology of counterfactuals, 
rather than truth conditions for counterfactuals,
but many of the same elements are appearing.
We have counterparts, and there are certain important relations
that decide which things are salient.
Rather than it being a similarity relation deciding which
worlds are close enough to be salient to the truth of a counterfactual,
we have some metric of salience that decides which past observations
count as evidence for (or against) the truth of a counterfactual.
Presumably one could build a more formal account
of the conditions under which certain observations count
as evidence for the truth of a counterfactual along these lines,
but I don't feel like doing that, and I feel like it would probably
end up being rather similar to the formal analysis that already exists
for the semantics case.

However, I would like to say something about salience.
Part of learning is working out which sorts of things count as evidence for
which sorts of other things.
It seems silly to say it, but the important respect of salience
that past balls have to the current ball is that they are not attached to anything
that would impede their fall.
Humans are quite good at coming to know which are the salient
aspects of comparison with respect to working out which past experiences
are evidence for the counterfactual in question.
Indeed, in the past people have called these salient aspects of comparison
"properties" and used them to *explain* the ball's falling.
I don't want to do that, but it seems that there's a neat story to tell
as to the epistemology of properties and kinds in terms
of those properties and kinds that we have successfully used in 
assessing the truth of these "predictive counterfactuals".

# Doing away with Possible Worlds?

Now it seems odd to have our semantics and our epistemology
appealing to thoroughly different kinds of things (possible worlds counterparts
versus actual world counterparts).
Could we perhaps just make the semantics rely on actual world
counterparts as well?
Does this sort of approach run into any difficulties that
the standard Lewisian programme doesn't?
I forsee difficulties with cashing out counterparthood
and similarity (or salience) but those are also the things
that are hard for the standard picture.
I want to turn this into an argument for a kind of 
"actual-world" ersatzism, but I'm sure that's already been done.

# The Physically Impossible?

This, of course, only works for counterfactuals
that deal with what's physically possible.
I have not observed any instances of the laws of nature being otherwise
than they are.
So the account I sketched above can only deal with counterfactuals
where the actual laws of physics hold.
But then, I have much less of a firm idea about why it's important
to have definite answers to questions about those more far-fetched counterfactuals.

Some "different-physics" counterfactuals
are easy.
Take the counterfactual scheme "If gravity followed an inverse cube law then *X*".
This hypothesis or supposition *specifies* how the laws of nature are
different, and thus working out whether it is true is a matter of
working out whether *X* follows from the specified alternate physics.
The truth of the counterfactual becomes an exercise in mathematics.

But the stronger response to the criticism that this view of counterfactuals
only deals with the actually physically possible is to argue that other counterfactuals
don't need to be dealt with.
There are some kinds of counterfactuals where, on this account, 
no observation could give you evidence of their truth.
This seems to me to speak against such counterfactuals having truth values.
If we are being good empiricists, then there are no facts about
things for which there couldn't possibly be any evidence!
