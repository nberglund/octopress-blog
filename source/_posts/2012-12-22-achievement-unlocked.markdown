Without wanting to toot my own trumpet, as they say,
various things have occurred recently.
If life were a video game, I would be winning at the moment.
Here, in no particular order, are some things that would have earned
me "mad points" in Sim Seamus.

<!-- more -->

 - I submitted my PhD dissertation which stood at just over 90,000 words.
 - I passed my viva with minor corrections.
 Once I've finished the corrections, the dissertation will appear on my website.
 - I was offered and have accepted a three year postdoc position at LMU's
 [Munich Centre for Mathematical Philosophy](http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html).
 - I have won the Watkins prize.
 Quoting from the announcement on the LSE philosophy news page:
 "The Watkins Prize is given to an outstanding student working in an area related to
 the research interests of Professor John Watkins:
 philosophy of science, political philosophy, decision theory and philosophy of biology."
 My dissertation chapter on "Imprecise Decisions" was the work in question.

So there you have it.
Next up on my to do list is get some darn papers published.
