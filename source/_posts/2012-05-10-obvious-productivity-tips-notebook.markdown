Here is a really obvious tip, 
but one that I've found extremely useful.
When you're reading something,
take notes.
That way, when you later come to be writing about that thing,
you can go back to your notes and easily find those passages
that are key to the argument.
You can find what you thought the weaknesses were and all that.
It's a much easier way of rediscovering that choice quote
or neat passage than having to reread the paper or chapter.

To make this work, 
you need to be able to find the notes you made
when you need to come back to them.
For this reason, 
you should make your notes in a notebook;
and not on randomly grabbed scrap paper,
as I used to do.

OK, this may seem really obvious,
but it has probably been one of the single most
useful bits of discipline I have adopted while
writing my thesis.
Now I'm coming back to writing up all the things I've been thinking about
over the last few months, 
and it's really useful to be able to go back and quickly find out
why I didn't find so-and-so's argument convincing.

Back before I kept a notebook,
there was a particular little proof that I needed
that I ended up recreating from scratch on several
occasions as I lost the bits of paper I'd written
it out on.
