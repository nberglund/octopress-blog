Inspired by a recent 
[xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/1133/),
people have started to try to explain complex stuff using only the
1000 most common words.
There's a [hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23upgoerfive)
and everything.
There's a special [text editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) 
that keeps you on track.
Taking time out from the dreaded thesis corrections,
I'm going to try to describe my thesis in this restricted way.

<!-- more -->

So here goes:

{% blockquote %}
Sometimes you can not know anything. You don't know enough facts to make the things you believe be like people want them to be. I think this means we need a better way to talk about how strong you believe things that lets you have very not strong things you believe that don't act in the way people expect.

I show that the normal way people talk about the way you believe things isn't good. They think too many things about how you believe things. When you don't think those things about how to believe things you get a new way of thinking about how to believe things. This new picture of how to believe is a bit like the old one, but it is also better.

Also you use the things you believe to help you pick what things to do. The new picture of how to believe makes picking what to do hard. I talk about this a lot and think about what we want to do with our picture of how to pick what to do.

I then use this new picture of believing and picking what to do to talk about all the ways we don't know what is going on with rain and sun and things like that. This is important because we need to pick what to do, but we don't know what the rain and sun will do. 
{% endblockquote %}

It's rather difficult. I'm sure if I thought about it a bit more I could improve this.
But I don't think it would help all that much.
I don't think this actually makes things easier to understand what my project is about.
I'm going to be trying the same thing with my EPSA and BSPS abstracts in the near future.

Here's a much more successful `#upgoerfive` attempt.
This time, I was just trying to summarise my research interests.

{% blockquote %}
I think about things like how the things you believe fit together. And what we mean when we talk about pictures of what things there are and how they move around.
{% endblockquote %}

I'm actually quite pleased with that.
