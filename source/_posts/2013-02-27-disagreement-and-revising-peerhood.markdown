Here's a thing I noticed recently during an interesting reading group discussion here at MCMP.
Disagreement is intensional.
We can disagree about whether Superman is in the room,
even if we agree that Clark Kent is in the room.
I'm not sure whether this has been noticed, or whether it has any interesting consequences,
but it seemed an interesting fact.

<!-- more -->

Now, this is an interesting thing in and of itself,
but I actually want to use it to talk about a more general phenomenon.
I want to talk about when it's legitimate to revise how competent you are
in the light of learning that you disagree with me.
Obviously, we don't want to do this too often or I will
never respond to testimonial evidence.
This would be a bad thing.
Indeed, it is such a bad thing that 
[David Christensen](http://fitelson.org/seminar/christensen.pdf)
feels moved to ruled out ever changing opinions about competence 
in the light of disagreement.
This he calls a principle of "Independence"

Back to our disagreement about Superman.
It seems that if we learn we disagree about whether Superman is in the room,
and you believe he is not in the room, then maybe you should revise your beliefs.
But if we disagree that Superman is in the room and I believe he is in the room,
(since I know Superman is Clark Kent and we both know Clark Kent is in the room)
then it seems that this is good evidence that you don't know that Superman is Clark Kent,
not evidence that one of us has made some serious mistake with respect to recognising who is in the room.
So even if I take you to be my peer with respect to recognising people in a room,
we don't have equal reason to change our beliefs.

Well, perhaps what's going on is that we aren't peers with respect to recognising
Superman, since I know an important fact about Superman that you don't.
Even if I believed (before the disagreement) that you *did* know Superman is Clark Kent,
it seems that I should revise that belief, rather than revise the belief that Superman is in the room.
This of course violates the "Independence" principle which says that learning of a disagreement
shouldn't lead you to revise your beliefs about peerhood.
That is, if I had a prior belief that you were my peer with respect to
Superman recognition, your failure to recognise Superman
is evidence you aren't really my peer.
It might also be evidence that Superman really isn't in the room,
or that Superman isn't Clark Kent.
That is, there are many ways I could revise my beliefs in response to the disagreement,
but some revisions are easier than others.

Cases of disagreement can perhaps be viewed as cases of coming to have an inconsistent belief
set and then having to revise the set.
So you start out with the following beliefs:

 - I am good at having true beliefs about $X$.
 - You are as good at having true beliefs about $X$.
 - I do/don't believe $X$.
 
I then learn:

 - You don't/do believe $X$.

There seems to be some serious tension between these four beliefs.
Something has got to give.
The Independence assumption seems to make the first two of my beliefs unrevisable.
I could drop one or both of latter two beliefs.
There seems to be something *ad hoc* or arbitrary about dropping either one belief,
so I should drop both and suspend judgement as to whether $X$.
This is what the "Equal Weight View" amounts to in cases of categorical belief like this.

In the Superman/Clark Kent example, I find it more reasonable that the belief about your
competence or your reliability is the one that should be dropped.
Let's take for granted that "Superman is Clark Kent" is unrevisable for now.
I am so sure of my belief that Superman is in the room that my belief
about your competence is less entrenched -- more easily revisable --
than my belief about Superman being in the room.
Even if "Superman is Clark Kent" is not unrevisable,
it still seems like the least strongly held of my beliefs
is that you are competent at recognising Superman.
Or rather, what revision is easiest for me in this circumstance is to drop
that belief.

Here's another example.
We are both trying to do the sum $38\times 42$.
I say it is 1596, you say it is 1594.
Under most circumstances I take you to be a peer about arithmetic.
But in this case, I spotted that $38\times 42 = (40-2)(40+2) = 1600 - 4$.
So the best explanation of the disagreement is that you did not spot this trick
and you have made a mistake.
Again, it seems like there's something about this example that suggests
revising the peerhood assumption, rather than effecting an epistemic compromise.
Note I am not revising my belief that we are generally equally competent at arithmetic,
I am revising only the belief that in this case, there's something (the trick) that
makes my belief in the answer less revisable.

I think the right way to approach this area is to think in terms
of an agent's beliefs about her own competence and the competence of others.
What this actually amounts to, or what competence actually is, I don't know yet.
Watch this space.
