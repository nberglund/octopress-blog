I recently read some Raymond Chandler books on kindle.
*The Big Sleep*, *Farewell My Lovely* and *The Long Goodbye*, if you're interested.
Here are some bits of those books I felt compelled to highlight as I was reading.
This probably tells you more about me than it does about Chandler.

{% blockquote %}
You have to hold your teeth clamped around Hollywood to keep from chewing on stray blondes
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
I don't have anything really exciting to drink like nitro-glycerine or distilled tiger's breath
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
I drove back to Hollywood feeling like a short length of chewed string
{% endblockquote %}

These quotes don't really do justice to the books.
I enjoyed them all:
Chandler's writing is tight and the stories compelling.
When you first start reading them you have to get over the fact that they sound like
the dialogue that films like *The Naked Gun* and *Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid*
are parodying (because that's what they are parodying).
For example, *The Big Sleep* opens like this:

{% blockquote %}
It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.
{% endblockquote %}

Once you stop reading it in Leslie Nielsen's voice,
once you get into it, they're really good stories.
