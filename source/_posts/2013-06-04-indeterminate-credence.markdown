This is the first of a series of posts I am going to write as a way to get together my thoughts for a new paper.
An early version of this stuff appeared in my thesis, so I already have a pretty good idea what I'm going to be writing
about.
The paper is ultimately going to be about indeterminate credence.
I think there are plenty of disparate reasons for perhaps wanting to take
imprecise or indeterminate credence seriously, so I'm going to write a paper outlining them all.

<!-- more -->

First, a note on terminology.
I'm pretty used to calling these things "imprecise credences",
but [I've been convinced](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/47077/) 
that it's probably better to call them "indeterminate credences",
since "imprecise credence" could have another meaning.
Basically, the "imprecise probabilities" terminology is all 
[Peter Walley's](http://books.google.de/books/about/Statistical_reasoning_with_imprecise_pro.html?id=Nk9Qons1kHsC&redir_esc=y) 
fault.
Well, at least it's better than "mushy credence".
Ugh.
I'm going to try to stick to talking about indeterminate credence,
but I expect I won't manage.
Also, I'm going to try having a [page where I list all the posts in this series](/indeterminate-credence-index).

Here's how [Adam Elga](http://www.princeton.edu/~adame/papers/sharp/elga-subjective-probabilities-should-be-sharp.pdf) 
motivates indeterminate credence:

> A stranger approaches you on the street and starts
> pulling out objects from a bag. 
> The first three objects he pulls out are a
> regular-sized tube of toothpaste, a live jellyfish, and a travel-sized tube
> of toothpaste. 
> To what degree should you believe that the next object
> he pulls out will be another tube of toothpaste?

I should note that Elga is no fan of indeterminate credence, but I think this story is an excellent
example.
The idea is that no particular precise degree of belief seems rationally justified on the basis of this
bizarre ocurrence.
Indeterminate credence is an attempt to offer a formal model of your belief
state in this (and other epistemologically similar) situations.

OK.
This is a sort of warm-up post where I'm just going to put out some sort of formal details I'll need later.
I'm going to assume everyone knows what a probability function is.
I'm going to use $p\_1,p\_2,\dots$ for probability functions.
Indeterminate credence is represented by a set of probability functions $C$.
Call $C(X)$ the set of values that $p\in C$ assign to $X$.
$C^\*(X)$ and $C\_\*(X)$ are going to be the upper and lower ends of $C(X)$ respectively.
So $C(J)=[0,1]$ where "$J$" is the proposition that a jellyfish will be
the next item out of the bag.
This represents complete ignorance about what will be drawn next.

That's all for now.
The aim of this post is really just to set up the groundwork for
a new spate of blogging.
I'm looking to do a post every couple of days for the next few weeks.
That way, I should be well on my way to having this paper in preliminary draft form
in the near future.
