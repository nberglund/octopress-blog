This is the blog of Seamus Bradley,
a philosophy PhD student at the London School of
Economics.
"A rude assembly" is an anagram of my name.
My "professional" website (where I keep my CV,
my papers and so on) is accessible through the
"[home](http://www.seamusbradley.net)" link at the top there.

This blog is powered by the [octopress](http://octopress.org)
blogging framework.
There are no "comment" facilities on the blog.
If you want to talk about a post, my twitter and
google plus should be available on the right there,
and my email is on my main site.
In fact, you can also email me at: 
`blog` at the current domain name.
